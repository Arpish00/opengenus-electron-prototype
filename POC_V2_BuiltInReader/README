## Built-In PDF Reader with Custom Protocol (V2)

This version uses the built-in PDF reader with a custom protocol to serve PDFs.

Whatâ€™s Inside:

- Uses Electron's built-in PDF viewer for PDF rendering.
- Implements a custom protocol (internal-pdf://) to serve PDFs without directly exposing file paths.
